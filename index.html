            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Education for all – A Dream</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a very important factor in the economic development of any
                country. India since the early days of independence has always focused on improving the literacy rate in
                our country. Even today the government runs many programs to promote Primary and Higher Education in
                India. Let us study more about them. Though the education level has increased for both youth as well as
                adults, still the number of illiterates is as much as the population was at the time of independence.
                The constituent assembly passed the Constitution of India in the year 1950. Free and compulsory
                education for the children till 14 years of age within 10 years from the commencement of constitution
                was noted as Directive Principal of the constitution. Following are the factors which make education for
                all a dream:

                Gender bias,
                Low rural access,
                Increasing number of illiterates,
                Privatization,
                Low expenditure on education by government.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Free and Compulsory Education</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The education commission (1964-66) recommended that at least 6% of GDP
                should be spent on education to make a recognizable growth rate in education. In December 2002, the
                government of India, through its 86th amendment of the Constitution of India, declared for free and
                compulsory education as a fundamental right to all children in the age group of 6-14 years.

                The Tapas Majumdar Committee was appointed by the government of India in the year 1998. The committee
                estimated an expenditure of Rs. 1.37 Lakh crore (approx) for 1998-99 to 2006-07, to cater all Indian
                children of 6-14 years age group, under the umbrella of school education.

                Currently, the expenditure is around 4%, which has to be increased to 6% to reach desired results in
                years to come. Government levies education cess at the rate of 2% on all union taxes. The revenues from
                education cess will be earmarked for spending on elementary education.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Growth in Government Expenditure on Education</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The percentage of expenditure on education out of total government
                expenditure is the indicator of the importance of education in the scheme of expenses before the
                government. The commitment level towards the development of education in our country can be shown by the
                percentage of expenditure done on education out of total GDP.

                During 1952-2010, the percentage of total education expenditure out of total government expenditure
                increased from 7.92% to 11.10%. At the same time, the percentage of GDP of the country increased from
                0.64% to 3.25%. As the expenditure on education was not constant during that time, the growth of country
                was irregular in that era.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Education system</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81%
                for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18,
                84.7% for male and 70.3% for female. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and
                29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. India's improved education system is often cited as one of
                the main contributors to its economic development.

                Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to
                various public institutions. While enrolment in higher education has increased steadily over the past
                decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 26.3% in 2019, there still remains a significant
                distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations, a challenge that
                will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's

                comparatively young population
                Currently, the expenditure is around 4%, which has to be increased to 6% to reach desired results in
                years to come. </p>
